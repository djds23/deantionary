[Deantionary](http://deantionary.com/) is a silly dictionary that you can use for free

It has a very simple auto correct and is subject to change quite frequently

I built this tool to learn more about react.js.

Details about the SpellChecker can be found in this article:

TODO: Add pagination and autoscrolling for suggested words of over 10 words
